The Random forest (RF) fire prediction model is developed to precdict the fire prone areas.
It is used for the prediction in Current conditions, Future Scenarios (IPCC based Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs))
The RF model trained based on key parameters includes SNP-VIIRS fire incident point and Other 20 variables i.e Biophysical paraterers, key bioclim data, Topography, and soil characteristics
The accuracy od the model is estimated for the current years based on 25% of fire incident points and new fire reported points.
it provides the higher efficacy as comparision to other linear models.
